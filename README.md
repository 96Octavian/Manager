# Manager
## Manager for my running processes
The executable should be placed in the same directory of a folder containing all the scripts to be run, and such folder should be named `startup_scripts`. 
Hidden scripts - starting with a dot '.' - will be ignored. 
Every script should have a specific internal structure - to be defined - and basically just execute a command and return it PID.
